// Static tasks configuration.

// Example:
[
    {
        "label": "Screen",
        "command": "./screen.sh",
        // What to do with the terminal pane and tab, after the command had finished:
        // * `never` — Do nothing when the command finishes (default)
        // * `always` — always hide the terminal tab, hide the pane also if it was the last tab in it
        // * `on_success` — hide the terminal tab on task success only, otherwise behaves similar to `always`
        "hide": "never",
        // Represents the tags for inline runnable indicators, or spawning multiple tasks at once.
        "tags": []
